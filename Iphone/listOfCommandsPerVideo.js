//She was warned
//She was given an explanation
//Nevertheless she persisted
//Gen-Z Kids are not afraid
//America is home to all
//no ban
//no wall
//we all live in this small planet
//We all cherish our children's future
//We are all mortal
//I came, I saw, I conquered
//I went to a ball
//I got a trophy
//we are the people, we got a Story
//just say no
//this nation will rise up
